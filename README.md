## Available Droids `c3po-droids-alist`

`assistant`, `corrector`, `developer`, and `rewriter`.

Each of the droids defined in `c3po-droids-alist` will automatically have two functions created: `-new-chat` and `-new-chat-replace-region`.

The result for all the droids is:
- `c3po-assistant-new-chat`
- `c3po-assistant-new-chat-replace-region`
- `c3po-corrector-new-chat`
- `c3po-corrector-new-chat-replace-region`
- `c3po-developer-new-chat`
- `c3po-developer-new-chat-replace-region`
- `c3po-rewriter-new-chat`
- `c3po-rewriter-new-chat-replace-region`

### `-new-chat` functions

These functions will always start a new conversation, and this is how a prompt is selected:

``` mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[M-x] -->B(c3po-_droid_-new-chat)
    B --> C{A region is active}
    C -->|No| E[Ask user for prompt]
    E -->F[ChatGPT]
    C --> |Yes| D{Was called with\nuniversal-argument?}
    D -->|Yes| G[Ask user for prompt prefix]
    D -->|No\nUse region as prompt| F
    G -->|prompt=prefix+region| F
```

These droids can also be easily accessed using `c3po-droids-dispatch`.

### `-new-chat-replace-region` functions

These functions will only work on active regions, and also support an additional prefix via `universal-argument`.

## Additional Functions

- `c3po-explain-code` Use this over a region.

You can also replace it easily by calling `C-u c3po-developer-new-chat` and adding the prefix "explain this code."

## Adding new droids

The core configuration of the droids relies on `c3po-droids-alist`.

### Alist entry

A new droid is created using this template:

``` emacs-lisp
(droid-name . (
            :pre-processors ... <optional>
            :post-processors ... <optional>
            :transient-key ...   <optional>
            :system-prompt ""))
```

You can also use the helper function `c3po-add-new-droid-with-defaults-processors`.

### Pre-processors

- Called before calling the OpenAI API.
- Each pre-processor function receives the droid and the user prompt.
- You can write your own pre-processor, for example, write all the conversations to a persistent file.
- This is what the default `c3po-add-to-buffer-pre-processor` does:

``` emacs-lisp
(defun c3po-add-to-buffer-pre-processor (droid prompt)
  "Pre-processor to add the DROID and PROMPT to the `c3po-buffer-name'."
  (c3po-append-result
   (if (c3po-is-initial-system-message-p)
       (format "\n# Chat (%s) - %s\n## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Prompt\n%s\n" droid (format-time-string "%A, %e %B %Y %T %Z") prompt)
     (format "## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Prompt\n%s\n" prompt)))) ;; for replies
```

### Post-processors

- Called after receiving the OpenAI result.
- Each post-processor function receives the droid, the user prompt, and the result. (advanced usage see args).
- You can write your own post-processor, for example, write all the conversations to a persistent file.
- This is what the default `c3po-add-to-buffer-post-processor` does:

``` emacs-lisp
(defun c3po-add-to-buffer-post-processor (_droid _prompt result &rest _args)
  "Post-processor to add the RESULT to the `c3po-buffer-name'."
  (c3po-append-result (format "### ü§ñ Answer\n%s\n" result))
  (pop-to-buffer c3po-buffer-name)
  (goto-char (point-max))
  (recenter))
```

- The `corrector` droid uses this post-processors:

``` emacs-lisp
:post-processors (c3po-show-diff-post-processor c3po-copy-clipboard-post-processor)
```

### Default droids configuration

The default droids are created using:

``` emacs-lisp
(defvar c3po-droids-alist
  '(
    (assistant . (
                  :pre-processors (c3po-add-to-buffer-pre-processor)
                  :post-processors (c3po-add-to-buffer-post-processor)
                  :transient-key "a"
                  :system-prompt "You are a helpful assistant. Keep it concise."))
    (corrector . (
                  :pre-processors nil
                  :post-processors (c3po-show-diff-post-processor c3po-copy-clipboard-post-processor)
                  :transient-key "c"
                  :system-prompt "Please act as my grammar assistant...<and much more>"))
    (developer . (
                  :pre-processors (c3po-add-to-buffer-pre-processor)
                  :post-processors (c3po-add-to-buffer-post-processor)
                  :transient-key "d"
                  :system-prompt "You're a programming expert who can provide guidance...<and much more>"))
    (rewriter . (
                  :pre-processors (c3po-add-to-buffer-pre-processor)
                  :post-processors (c3po-add-to-buffer-post-processor c3po-show-diff-post-processor)
                  :transient-key "r"
                  :system-prompt "Please act as my writing assistant with a programming expertise...<and much more> ")))
  "Alist of personas with a Plist of properties.
Call `c3po-make-droid-helper-functions to have the helper functions created.")

```

### Example new droid

``` emacs-lisp
;; in my emacs config I have:
  (c3po-add-new-droid-with-defaults-processors 'synonymizer "s"
                                                 "
I want you to act as a synonyms provider.
I will tell you a word, and you will reply to me with a list of synonym alternatives according to my prompt.
Provide a list of 5 synonyms per prompt, 3 short examples, and a list of 5 antonyms.
You will only reply the words list, and nothing else, please use this template:
**Synonyms:**
-

**Examples:**
